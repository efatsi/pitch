To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Install front endy dependencies `npm install`
3. Watch your javascripts if you're messing with those `npm run watch`
4. Start Phoenix router with `iex -S mix`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
